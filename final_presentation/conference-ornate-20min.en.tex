% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.

\subsection{Parallelization Opportunities}

\begin{frame}{Flow is moving...}
	  \begin{itemize}
	    \item
	    Major oportunity: Make more than one flow move in parallel.

\section{Solution}

\subsection{Main Ideas}

\begin{frame}{Conflicts}
\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Every thread is responsible for one node/pixel.
 \item
 Apply Push and Relabel to every node.
 \item
 \alert{How to avoid conflicts?}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conflicts}
\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Every thread is responsible for one node/pixel.
 \item
 Apply Push and Relabel to every node.
 \item
 \alert{How to avoid conflicts?}
 \item
 Dividing kernel in parts or using atomic operations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Convergence}
\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Every thread is responsible for one node/pixel.
 \item
 Apply Push and Relabel to every node. \alert{Repeat it until flow stops changing.}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Convergence}
\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Every thread is responsible for one node/pixel.
 \item
 Apply Push and Relabel to every node. \alert{Repeat it until flow stops changing?}
 \item
 Convergence is too slow $\rightarrow$ Global Relabel.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Speeding Up}

\begin{frame}{Global Relabel}
\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Global Relabel: Read \alert{every} neighbor edge, get label if connected.
 \item
 Compress neighborhood!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Global Relabel}
\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Global Relabel: After changing label, inactive.
 \item
  \_\_syncthreads\_or(comp\_n \& (1 $<<$ 8))
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Push}
\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Push: Reads every neighbor's height.
 \item
 Shared memory!
 \item
 or compress!
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Push}
\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Push: Excess is written by the owner thread and by neighbors.
 \item
 Shared memory?
 \item
 Not good. Perhaps too many \_\_syncthreads().
 \item
 Better stay with atomic? Or Timo Stich's Wave...
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Extra}
\begin{itemize}
 \item
 Suitable block size (32x8 and 88-100\%).
 \item
 Block activity list.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Performance Comparison}

\begin{frame}{Comparison with Previous Works}
\begin{itemize}
\item
CudaCuts by Vibhav Vineet and P. J. Narayanan, 2008.
\item
Fastest known CPU implementation by Boykov \emph{et al.}.
\item
Fastest known GPU implementation (current NPP implementation [Timo Stich 2011])
\item
On the same dataset (changing size) = proportion is constant, 2-3x slower than NPP.
\end{itemize}

 \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Dataset}   &  \textbf{CPU}    & \textbf{CudaCuts} & \textbf{Ours}    & \textbf{NPP} \\
\hline
Flower (600x450)   &  191 ms & 18 ms    & 9 ms    & 5 ms   \\
Sponge (640x480)   &  268 ms & 21 ms    & 10 ms   & 4 ms   \\
Person (600x450)   &  210 ms & 28 ms    & 13 ms   & 9 ms   \\
Rihanna (3600x3600)&  N/A    & 748 ms   & 450 ms  & 150 ms \\
